    <h1 id="about-this-organization">About This Organization</h1>
    <p>This is an organization for students in Thornton Middle School to make friends, make repositories anything related to thornton, etc. If you have a great idea for a repository and/or do a large part of one, you can add your name its credits! If you are looking for someone to collaborate with on a new project, check the members page. No one is expected to do something; working on a project is completely optional and is something you can just do in your spare time. </p>
    <h2 id="joining">We are always looking for people to join and help the Thornton Community! Spread the word and invite people to join this organization!</h2>
    <h3 id="rules-policies">Rules &amp; Policies</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>No cyberbullying in code comments, issue pages, pr requests, conversations, discussions, and any other way to communicate.</li>
    <li>Messages here cannot be taken to start bullying in-person (e.g. at school) or online (e.g. a group chat).</li>
    <li>You cannot use projects in this organization to circumvent school policies. Nor can a project&#39;s purpose be to do so. One example of such violation is a project that lets you bypass payments, such as new IDs or socials.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Please report any violation of these rules ASAP to a trustable member of this organization and we will try to get things sorted. Report to school staff only if things escalate too far and out of control.</strong></p>
